    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a passionate GIS analyst and cartographer specializing in QGIS-based spatial analysis and mapping projects. I love transforming geographic data into visual stories that support environmental and urban planning efforts.<br> <br>I'm a Master's student in Data Science at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, specializing in Spatial Analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). My academic journey has equipped me with a robust foundation in data analytics, spatial modeling, and geospatial technologies.

        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Air University, where I developed a strong background in software development, networking, and system administration. During my undergraduate studies, I gained hands-on experience in creating mobile and web applications, and I acquired substantial knowledge in networking, switching, and routing.
        
        Professionally.<br> I've completed three six-month internships that have enriched my skill set:<br><br>
        
        <strong>Networking Internship:</strong><br> Focused on network infrastructure, configuration, and maintenance.<br>
        
        <br><strong>Data Analytics and Data Science Internship:</strong><br> Engaged in data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to support decision-making processes.<br>
        
        <br> <strong>Full-Stack Web Development Internship:</strong><br> Worked on both front-end and back-end development, contributing to dynamic and responsive web applications.<br>
        
        <br>Beyond academics and professional experiences, I have a passion for community service. I've organized fundraisers for orphanages, demonstrating my commitment to social responsibility.
        
        In my leisure time, I enjoy playing challenging strategy video games like Age of Empires, which sharpen my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.<br><br>
        
        Recently, I've discovered a profound interest in cartography and spatial data visualization. Completing my Master's-level course in Spatial Analytics and GIS has sparked a passion for map-making. I'm eager to pursue career opportunities that merge data science, GIS, and artificial intelligence to address complex spatial problems and contribute to innovative solutions.

    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <div class="portfolio">
      <div class="portfolio-item">
        <iframe src="images\Map 1 Detroit heat map.pdf"></iframe>
        <p>This map visualizes the spatial distribution of CVS and Walgreens pharmacy locations against Detroit’s population density. Using gridded population data and geocoded store locations, it highlights the greater coverage of CVS (14) compared to Walgreens (7). This map was created in ArcGISpro.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-item">
        <iframe src="images\Map 2 Earth Quake Analysis.pdf"></iframe>
        <p>A symbolic and labeled global map showcasing countries with historically severe earthquakes. This learning map was created to practice cartographic design, including symbology, labeling, and visual hierarchy in QGIS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-item">
        <iframe src="images\Map 3 Parcel Creation.pdf"></iframe>
        <p>This project involved georeferencing a scanned plat map and manually digitizing parcels over current basemaps. The goal was to reconstruct housing parcel boundaries with precision using QGIS geoprocessing and digitization tools.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-item">
        <iframe src="images\Map 4 River map new vs old.pdf"></iframe>
        <p>This comparative map visualizes the change in Rouge River’s flow by overlaying historical aerial imagery with digitized paths and performing a contour analysis on the modern DEM. It demonstrates the spatial impact of river channelization using QGIS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-item">
        <iframe src="images\Map 5 vending machines maping.pdf"></iframe>
        <p>This map displays the exact locations of vending machines on campus. Field data was collected using the Mergin Maps mobile app and synced through the Mergin Cloud platform, and the points were visualized in QGIS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-item">
        <iframe src="images\Map 6 Vending machines density heat map.pdf"></iframe>
        <p>Using a hexbin spatial analysis technique, this map quantifies the density of vending machines on campus to reveal clustering patterns and popular areas. Built entirely in QGIS with graduated color density styling.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-item">
        <iframe src="images\Map 7 Contour analysis.pdf"></iframe>
        <p>This map uses DEM elevation data to perform a contour analysis of terrain around the University of Michigan-Dearborn, identifying low-lying zones likely to support vernal pools. An environmental application of QGIS-based terrain modeling.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-item">
        <iframe src="images\MAP 8 Bluespot analysis using Saga next gen toolkit.pdf"></iframe>
        <p>A hydrological risk assessment map identifying potential flood zones and vernal pool formations using the Bluespot plugin in QGIS. The analysis highlights water-retaining depressions, aiding ecological planning and hazard prevention.</p>
